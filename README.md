# Introduction
This project is about creating a pretty neat toy with DOM manipulation skills. It’s a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

# Task
1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
* Create the divs using JavaScript.
* Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid 

2. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

3. Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
* Tip: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100.
* You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used.
